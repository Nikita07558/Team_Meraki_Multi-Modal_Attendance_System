## 🧠 Project Description
A robust and secure **multimodal attendance system** that uses:
-  **Facial Recognition**
-  **Voice Authentication**
-  **Location Verification**
to ensure accurate, real-time, and tamper-proof attendance — ideal for hybrid workplaces, educational institutions, and secure environments.

## 🚀 Tech Stack (in progress)
- Python
- OpenCV
- face_recognition
- dlib
- Flask (REST APIs)

## 📦 Modules
- ✅ Face Detection & Recognition (in development)
- 🔄 Voice Authentication (integration pending)
- 🗺️ Location Check(integration pending)

  ##  Work in Progress

- To save embeddings in database for scalability.
- Exploring liveness detection or blink detection for anti-spoofing.

## 🛠️ How to Run (Coming Soon)
Setup instructions and dependencies will be added once the modules are connected.

## 📌 Project Goal
To create a privacy-focused, secure, and accurate attendance system that reduces spoofing and enables smooth verification using multiple biometric and location inputs.

## 🤝 Contributions
For now, the team is working on their assigned modules. Contribution guidelines will be added once a base version is ready.
