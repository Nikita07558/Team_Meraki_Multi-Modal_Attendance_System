## üß† Project Description
A secure and automated **attendance system** that leverages **face recognition** to verify identity and mark attendance in real time.  
The system integrates **anti-spoofing techniques** such as blink/liveness detection to prevent fraudulent attempts and ensure reliability.  
Designed for **educational institutions, corporate workplaces, and high-security environments**, it reduces manual effort, eliminates proxy attendance, and provides an efficient solution for identity verification.  

## üöÄ Features  
- **Real-Time Face Detection & Recognition**  
  - Live webcam integration for seamless attendance.  
  - High-accuracy matching using FaceNet embeddings.  

- **Automatic Attendance Logging**  
  - Recognized faces are instantly marked in the backend with timestamp.  

- **Anti-Spoofing Security**  
  - Liveness detection and blink-based validation ensure only real users are authenticated.  

- **Scalability**  
  - Supports multiple users and maintains embeddings for fast recognition.  


## üõ†Ô∏è Tech Stack  
- **Face Recognition**: FaceNet, `face_recognition`, dlib, OpenCV  
- **Backend**: Python (Flask/FastAPI for APIs)  
- **Frontend**: Web interface for attendance visualization  
- **Database**: Postgresql   



## üìå Project Goal
To create a privacy-focused, secure, and accurate attendance system that reduces spoofing and enables smooth verification using Face recognition based attendance system.
